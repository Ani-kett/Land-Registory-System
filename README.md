  # Land-Registory-System
The Land Registry System is a decentralized application (DApp) built on Ethereum Blockchain using Solidity, Truffle, Web3.js, and Ganache. It provides a transparent, immutable, and secure platform for managing land ownership records. This project was created under the blockchain technology internship with VOIS and the Connecting Dreams Foundation.

# Main Functionality
* Secure Land Ownership Records: Store and verify land ownership details on the blockchain.
* Decentralized & Tamper-proof: Data is immutable and cannot be altered.
* Smart Contract-Based Transactions: Automated buying and selling of land.
* Ownership Transfer: Only verified users can transfer ownership.
* Role-based Access: Admins, buyers, and sellers have different access permissions.
* Transparent & Auditable: Anyone can verify transactions on the blockchain.

# Tech stack
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Smart Contracts: Solidity
* Blockchain Framework: Ethereum, Truffle
* Local Blockchain: Ganache, Web3.js
